About me
============
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Crockett Lab](http://www.crockettlab.org/) at Princeton University. I completed my PhD in Psychology at Johns Hopkins with [Marina Bedny](https://bednylab.com/index.html).

You can find my CV [here](https://judyseinkim.github.io/cv/), publications [here](https://judyseinkim.github.io/publications/), and descriptions of ongoing projects on this [page](https://judyseinkim.github.io/projects/). If you're looking for info on the Moral Narratives Workshop, go [here](https://moralnarratives.org)! 

Research
============
I'm interested in how different **structures in thought** (e.g., associations and intuitive theories) are transmitted through **testimony**. One goal of this research is to understand the structures themselves. For example, my recent work focuses on narratives -- what they are and how they help us organize and communicate about our experiences. I'm also interested in the social components of testimonial exchange -- e.g., inferences we make about our audiences, how we gain and give trust, and the role of power in who gets to speak at all.
