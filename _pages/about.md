Hi! I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Crockett Lab](http://www.crockettlab.org/) at Princeton University. I completed my PhD in psychology at Johns Hopkins with [Marina Bedny](https://bednylab.com/index.html).

My research interest is in how different **structures in thought** (e.g., associations and intuitive theories) are transmitted through **testimony**.

You can find my CV here, publications below, and descriptions of projects here. If you're looking for info on the [Moral Narratives Workshop](https://moralnarratives.org).
