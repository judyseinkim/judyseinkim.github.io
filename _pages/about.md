I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Crockett Lab](http://www.crockettlab.org/) at Princeton University. I completed my PhD in psychology at Johns Hopkins with [Marina Bedny](https://bednylab.com/index.html).

My research interest is in how different structures in thought (e.g., associations and intuitive theories) are transmitted through testimony.

You can find my CV [here](https://judyseinkim.github.io/cv/), publications below, and descriptions of ongoing projects [here](https://judyseinkim.github.io/projects/). If you're looking for info on the Moral Narratives Workshop, go [here](https://moralnarratives.org)!
